Especially for us in the U.S., as most don't know that the apple tree actually comes all the way from Central Asia!\nApprentice: what type of farming sydtem are you involved in?\nWizard: Not involved in one anymore! Just lived near one as a kid. It made me want to learn about them! For example, I learned that they've been grown for thousands of years in Asia/Europe, and then finally brought to North America by European colonists.\nApprentice: so what experience have you gained so far by your proximity?\nWizard: My parents just used to be farmers, who had apples as well. They only had a couple types, or cultivars, of apples, of which there are 7,500. There are so many different kinds and flavors of apple, you could try a different one every day for a year, and it would take you 20 years to try them all!\nApprentice: what what are the flavors there is?\nWizard: There's all kinds of flavors! Some are specifically bred to have tastes made for specific uses, like ones specifically for cooking, or to eat raw, or even for cider production.\nApprentice: how is cider production carried out?\nWizard: Cider production in particular involves selecting apple cultivars that are bred for their bitterness and dryness of flavour, as that makes the best cider. In addition, you have to make sure the fruit has high sugar levels, because those levels encourage fermentation and help to raise the fine alcohol levels.\nApprentice: whats the history of the earliest cultivation of apple tree?",

There's just something special about it. \nWizard: Have you ever eaten a flame broiled burger from burger king? They have always specialized in hamburgers.\nApprentice: I have! They taste really great but my big issue with them is that they add too much ketchup to their burgers. Also when it's not tomato season they can put out pretty rough tomatoes on the burger. \nWizard: Ketchup is sweet and tangy, do you not like the vinegar in it or do you just prefer more meat?\nApprentice: I think Ketchup is too sweet. It's almost like biting into a tomato that someone put sugar on. It's one of the worst things in terms of condiments. Although I would always prefer more meat. I tend to order a double hamburger so I can have two meat patties.\nWizard: What is your favorite condiment, if you don't like ketchup too much?\nApprentice: Honestly? Hot Sauce! I use different types on everything! I have about 30 different bottles of sauces at home that are all used for different things! \nWizard: Hot sauce is probably my favorite, too! You can eat it on anything!",

I get a bit weak when I don't eat carbs, and I am obsessed with fruit and veggies these days.\nWizard: Under 20g of carbs each day is the goal to remain in ketosis.  If you overeat carbs you feel REALLY unpleasant.  It really helps you stick to the diet, haha.  It would be tough to try it without animal protein in your diet, and maybe nearly impossible.\nApprentice: I eat a lot of plant protein, especially soy, which I know some people consider unhealthy. When I lost the most weight in my life, it was super low carb and very high protein, but I was eating a lot of meat back then. I was in constant ketosis.\nWizard: I think low-carb is really the way to go for weight loss, and I'd say a major factor is that you can't really drink beer, haha.  Once that was cut, the pounds started dropping off.  I'm looking into a cyclic ketogenic plan for when I stop losing weight as quickly.\nApprentice: Oh yeah, cutting out alcohol is hard, but I can just stick to skinny vodka!

I think if you are going to eat a dessert you might aswell eat it with sugar.\nApprentice: Haha. I agree. I'm enjoying some sugary strawberry marshmallows right now. Although tomorrow i'm starting a sugar free \"diet\". \nWizard: Nooooooo you cant start a sugar free diet. How are you going to eat cheesecake which has sweet layers filled with sugar?\nApprentice: Bahaha. Well, I'll make my raw vegan type. Stopping to eat refined sugar is probably one of the most effective way to reduce the risk of most causes of mortality.\nWizard: Sugar is used in all kinds of stuff though. Coffee, tea, cookies, and soft drinks. How are you going to live without those?\nApprentice: Well, I like my tea and coffee without sugar. The hardest is avoiding it in processed foods.. so I'm actually cutting out all processed foods as well! I work in the health industry, so I'm used to doing stuff like this!\nWizard: Do you drink Iced sweet tea? I live in the south and that is the number one thing to drink around here.
